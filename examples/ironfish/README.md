# makepad-example-ironfish

## Overview

This is Ironfish, Makepad Framework's first complete example application. It is developed by This Is Not Rocket Science under a MIT license.

Ironfish is a feature rich synthesizer which includes

- various advanced oscillator types (i.e. Harmonic and Hyper Saw)
- common filters
- multiple effects (i.e. delay, chorus and bitcrusher)
- midi support
- a playable on screen keyboard
- live audio visualization
- a playful grid sequencer

The application showcases these Makepad Framework features:
- the layout system
- available stylable widgets
- cross platform support (Ironfish runs on desktop, mobile and web for which it utilizes AudioWorklets)
- the small download footprint of Makepad applications, which makes the synthesizer load virtually as fast in browsers as it does on desktop
- the framework's shared memory Wasm features
- the ability to even run complex heavy duty applications smoothly

## Installation Instructions

```cargo install makepad-example-ironfish; makepad-example-ironfish```
